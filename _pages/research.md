Within computer science, my research gravitates towards handling data in edge systems. My research sets the roadmaps across the hardware-software trade-offs for the next generation of edge systems. To effectively maneuver the constraints of edge systems, my research develops novel machine learning techniques and exploits hardware-software synergy.
