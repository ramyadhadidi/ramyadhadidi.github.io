# Academic Research {#academic-research}

During my PhD studies, my research primarily focused on the field of computer science, with a particular emphasis on managing data in edge systems. I strived to establish guidelines that navigate the trade-offs between hardware and software for the next generation of these systems. To effectively address the unique constraints presented by edge systems, my work involved the development of innovative machine learning techniques and the exploitation of hardware-software synergy.

# Undergraduate Research {#undergraduate-research}

I enjoyed working closely with our talented undergraduate students during my PhD. Together, we achieved significant milestones and our collaborative efforts resulted in several publications. You can find the main website here, [HPArch Undergraduate Research](https://sites.gatech.edu/hparch/undergraduate-research/), although please note that it is no longer actively maintained. Feel free to explore the exciting final demos from our one or two semesters of hard work:

# Teaching {#teaching}

I derive my enjoyment in teaching not from the prestige that comes with the traditional teacher-student paradigm, but rather from the intellectual camaraderie shared among those with a common interest in certain subjects.  

My teaching journey began in high school where I taught a range of topics from calculating planetary trajectories to cosmology. We had a self-funded tradition where seniors passed on knowledge to their juniors in the same way they were taught. This was primarily due to the fact that even the basic concepts required for our astronomy Olympiad (unlike those in mathematics or chemistry) were not covered in most high school curriculums. (To this day, I believe [elliptic integrals](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/EllipticIntegral.html) may still be an unfamiliar concept to many!)  

During my undergraduate years, I served as a teaching assistant (TA) for 12 courses, predominantly in the field of computer architecture. In my senior year, I managed our Microprocessor Systems Laboratory at Sharif, which was the only resource for undergraduates seeking FPGA boards, MCUs, and processors faster than the basic [8051](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8051).  

While pursuing my PhD at Georgia Tech, I worked as a TA for 3 courses and taught an advanced course in computer organization (a senior-level course in computer architecture) as the primary instructor for two consecutive summers. Below are the websites of these courses.
