## More About Me

### Career Path

At [Rain.ai](https://rain.ai/), I embrace a role that's as varied as it is fulfilling. Here, my day-to-day involves AI accelerator architecture design, ML hardware-software codesign, workload analysis, profiling on real systems, and engaging with customers on a technical level. What I appreciate most about working in a startup environment is the opportunity it gives me to wear different hats. This diversity in my role not only aligns with my existing skills in areas like hardware-software codesign and machine learning but also challenges me to grow, especially in new aspects of in ML compilers and customer needs. I enjoy the balance of applying what I know and being pushed to learn more, ensuring that each day brings a new aspect of my expertise into play.

Before [Rain.ai](https://rain.ai/), I worked as a machine learning researcher at [SK hynix](http://www.skhynix.com/), where I focused on the intersection of hardware, software, and CMOS image sensors (CIS) to enable efficient execution of cutting-edge computer vision workloads. Later, at SK hynix, I worked on the implementation of novel algorithms in computational solid-state drives (SSD).

In 2018, I also had the enriching experience of being a Software Engineering Intern at Google, specifically with the Video Understanding Team. There, I contributed to the design of DNN models for analyzing YouTube video content, a role that enhanced my expertise in machine learning and video analytics in a practical, high-impact setting.

### Academic Background

I got my Ph.D. and Masters's degrees in computer science from the Georgia Institute of Technology. I had the pleasure to work with Professor [Hyesoon Kim](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~hyesoon/) at [HPArch](http://hparch.gatech.edu) lab. My research interests lie within computer architecture, but I am always eager to explore new areas. Specifically, I have worked on processing in and near memory, edge devices, robotics, and deep learning. My [thesis](http://hdl.handle.net/1853/64765) focused on enabling edge and IoT devices (i.e., resource-constrained devices, robots, and drones) to execute deep neural networks (DNNs) collaboratively, efficiently, securely, and reliably. I am excited to continue this work in industry and explore new ways of pushing the boundaries of edge systems.

My academic journey began at the Sharif University of Technology, where I earned a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering. In my senior year, I took on a significant role, managing our Microprocessor Systems Laboratory (MicroLab). This lab was a pivotal resource for undergraduates, being the only place offering access to advanced FPGA boards, MCUs, and processors beyond the basic 8051 model. Working with a range of technologies, from Altera to Xilinx FPGA boards, alongside robotics, microprocessors, and microcontrollers, was a defining experience. It deeply influenced my career path, steering me towards a focus in computer architecture.


### Early Inspirations and Interests

Astronomy captivated me during my high school years, leading to significant achievements in national and international olympiads, including two silver and one gold medal at the [IOAA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympiad_on_Astronomy_and_Astrophysics). Unlike other disciplines such as mathematics or chemistry, astronomy was not a standard part of high school curriculums. This gap compelled me to embark on a self-learning journey, where I had to seek out resources independently, establish a community, and teach myself. This early experience in self-education not only fueled my passion for astronomy but also instilled in me a lifelong habit of self-directed learning. This skill has been invaluable, enabling me to seamlessly transition into electronics and computer science, and continues to be a cornerstone of my personal and professional development.

### Personal Pursuits

In my leisure time, my interests are as diverse as they are engaging. From immersing myself in board games or grand strategy games by [Paradox Interactive](https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/) to hands-on maintenance of my car, I find joy in a variety of activities. This includes figuring out and teaching myself new skills, like designing custom boards with sensors or fixing an oil-fired boiler. Such DIY projects not only satisfy my curiosity but also resonate with my advocacy for open-source software, free internet, and the right to repair. I aspire to play post-rock music. Nature also offers me solace, and I pursue outdoor sports like squash, tennis, ping pong, soccer, rock climbing (especially bouldering), cycling, skiing, and backpacking.
