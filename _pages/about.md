__CS 4290/CS 6290/ECE 4100/ECE 6100__: I will be teaching high-performance computer architecture this summer. Feel free to send me an email if you have any questions.

I am a PhD student in Computer Science at Georgia Institute of Technology since 2014. I have the pleasure of working with Hyesoon Kim and my lab-mates in Hparch group. Our group research is focused on Computer Architecture. Specifically, I am working on 3D-stacked memories, processing in memory (PIM), and machine learning.

I received my bachelor's degree from the Sharif University of Technology in Electrical Engineering. Before that, in high school, I fell in love with astrophysics and I won a silver medal in International Olympiad of Astrophysics and Astronomy in 2009 (3rd [IOAA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympiad_on_Astronomy_and_Astrophysics)).

I am a fan of Linux, open source software, free Internet and github. I love any kinds of board games. I crave to play post-rock someday. I enjoy spending my time in nature. I play squash, do rock climbing and hiking.
