* Updates:  
    * _[Sep'19]_ __FPL Demo__: Check our demo [here](http://comparch.gatech.edu/hparch/fpl19).

    * _[April'19]_ __Undergraduate Research__: I am looking for undergraduates to work with me in our group. My research covers interdisciplinary areas: Architecture, robotics, ML, and systems. Any skill in EE and CS would be a good starting point to join us. We always try to find venues for our undergraduates to publish their work. Please send me an email if you are interested or if you want more about the projects. You will be working with [Hyesoon](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~hyesoon/), [Jiashen](https://jiashenc.github.io/cv/), and me. Current [list](https://parallel-ml.github.io/docs/people/people/) of people.

    * _[April'19]_ __CS 4290__: I will be teaching high-performance computer architecture summer 19 [(CS4290)](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~rhadidi6/cs4290/index.html). Feel free to send me an email if you have any questions. Everything in the course is the same as CS 6290/ECE 4100/ECE 6100.

    * _[March'19]_ __SysML Demo__: Check our demo [here](http://comparch.gatech.edu/hparch/sysml).



I am a Ph.D. student in computer science at Georgia Institute of Technology since 2014. I have the pleasure of working with Hyesoon Kim and my lab-mates in [HPArch](http://comparch.gatech.edu/hparch/) group. Our group's research is focused on computer architecture. Specifically, I have worked on 3D-stacked memories, processing in memory (PIM), and machine learning. Currently, I am working on enabling edge and IoT devices (i.e., resource-constrained devices) to execute deep neural networks (DNNs) collaboratively, efficiently, securely, and reliably.

I received my bachelor's degree from the Sharif University of Technology in electrical engineering, and my master's degree from Georgia Tech in computer science. In high school, I fell in love with astrophysics and won a silver medal in the International Olympiad of Astrophysics and Astronomy in 2009 (3rd [IOAA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympiad_on_Astronomy_and_Astrophysics)). I started to study computer architecture because I wanted to understand how 0s and 1s eventually created computers. Fortunately, I am still derived from the same curiosity every day.  

I am a fan of Linux, open source software, free Internet and github. I love any kinds of board games. I crave to play post-rock someday. I enjoy spending my time in nature. I play squash, tennis, ping pong, soccer, do rock climbing (bouldering specifically) and backpacking.
