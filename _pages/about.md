### About Me

I am a machine learning researcher at [SK hynix](http://www.skhynix.com/). I work at the intersection of hardware, software, and edge devices, in all of which focusing on the efficient execution of deep learning algorithms.

### More About Me!

I got my Ph.D. in computer science at the Georgia Institute of Technology in 2021. I had the pleasure to work with Professor [Hyesoon Kim](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~hyesoon/) at [HPArch](http://hparch.gatech.edu) lab. My area of research falls within computer architecture but I usually outreach to new areas. Specifically, I worked on processing in/near memory, edge devices, robotics, and deep learning. My [thesis](http://hdl.handle.net/1853/64765) focused on enabling edge and IoT devices (i.e., resource-constrained devices, robots, drones) to execute deep neural networks (DNNs) collaboratively, efficiently, securely, and reliably.  

I received my bachelor's degree from the Sharif University of Technology in electrical engineering, and my master's degree from Georgia Tech in computer science. I spend most of my time in high school on astronomy, and ended up with couple of medals in national and international olympiads (two silvers and one gold). From astronomy to electronics and then computer science is a long road, but that is a story for another day.  

I support Linux, open-source software, free Internet, and right to repair. I play all kinds of board and video games. I maintain my own car. I crave to play post-rock someday. I enjoy spending my time in nature. I play squash, tennis, ping pong, soccer, do rock climbing (bouldering specifically), and backpacking.


<!-- ## News
* _[Nov'20]_ Our paper titled Quantifying the Design-Space Tradeoffs in Autonomous Drones has been accepted to [ASPLOS'21](https://asplos-conference.org/).

* _[Oct'20]_ Our paper about intelligent accelerating sparse gathering for scaling recommendation systems is accepted to [HPCA'21](https://hpca-conf.org/2021/).

* _[Aug'20]_ Our paper about scalable systolic array implementation for deep learning is accepted to [ICCD'20](https://www.iccd-conf.com/Home.html).

* _[April'20]_ __CS 4290 (Summer20)__: I am teaching high-performance computer architecture this summer. You can check the [website](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~rhadidi6/cs4290-2020/index.html). Feel free to shot me an email if you have any questions.

* _[Mar'20]_ __PiZeroW__: I built a Pi Zero temperature monitoring with a webserver plus a Network-Wide ad Blocker, you can find the code [here](https://github.com/ramyadhadidi/pi_sensor_webserver). Interesting that with a single core my PiZero can run two webservers (pi-hole + dash), a DNS resolver with 2M domains on the blacklist updated every day, and a temperature logger with OLED updating every 30 seconds. However, people still rely on remote servers to do these simple tasks.

* _[Mar'20]_ Our paper about systolic array implementation for deep learning is accepted to [FCCM'20](https://www.fccm.org/).

* _[Feb'20]_ We have two new works on drones one at [CogArch](http://cogarch-workshop.org/) workshop, another at [ISPASS](https://www.ispass.org/) as a poster.

* _[Feb'20]_ Our paper about efficient SLAM implementation is accepted to [DAC'20](https://www.dac.com/).

Any skill in EE and CS would be a good starting point to join us. We always try to find venues for our undergraduates to publish their work. Please send me an email if you are interested or if you want more about the projects. You will be working with [Hyesoon](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~hyesoon/), [Jiashen](https://jiashenc.github.io/cv/), and me. Current [list](https://ramyadhadidi.github.io/resume/) of people.
