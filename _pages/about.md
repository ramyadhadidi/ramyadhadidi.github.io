* Update:  
__CS 4290/CS 6290/ECE 4100/ECE 6100__: I will be teaching high-performance computer architecture this summer. Feel free to send me an email if you have any questions.


I am a Ph.D. student in computer science at Georgia Institute of Technology since 2014. I have the pleasure of working with Hyesoon Kim and my lab-mates in Hparch group. Our group's research is focused on computer architecture. Specifically, I have worked on 3D-stacked memories, processing in memory (PIM), and machine learning. Currently, I am working on enabling edge and IoT devices (i.e., resource-constrained devices) to execute deep neural networks (DNNs) collaboratively, efficiently, securely, and reliably.

I received my bachelor's degree from the Sharif University of Technology in electrical engineering, and my master's degree from Georgia Tech in computer science. In high school, I fell in love with astrophysics and won a silver medal in the International Olympiad of Astrophysics and Astronomy in 2009 (3rd [IOAA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympiad_on_Astronomy_and_Astrophysics)). I started to study computer architecture because I wanted to understand how 0s and 1s eventually created computers. Fortunately, I am still derived from the same curiosity every day.  

I am a fan of Linux, open source software, free Internet and github. I love any kinds of board games. I crave to play post-rock someday. I enjoy spending my time in nature. I play squash, do rock climbing and hiking.
